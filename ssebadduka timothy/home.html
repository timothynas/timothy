<h1>BENEFITS OF COOKING GAS </h1>
<ol>
	<li>Clean and Efficient Burning: GAS is a clean-burning fuel, which means it produces fewer pollutants and particulate matter compared to some other cooking fuels, like wood or coal. This contributes to better indoor air quality and reduces the risk of respiratory problems</li>
	<li>Precise Temperature Control: GAS burners provide instant and precise temperature control. Cooks can easily adjust the flame size to achieve the desired cooking temperature, making it ideal for a wide range of cooking techniques. </li>
	<li>Convenience: GAS is readily available in portable cylinders, making it convenient for outdoor cooking, camping, and other activities where electricity or natural gas may not be accessible</li>
