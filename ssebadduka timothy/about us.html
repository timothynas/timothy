		<h1>AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY</h1>

		<h2>Affordability:</h2>
		<ol class="afordi">

		<li>Abundant Supply: LPG is derived from natural gas processing and crude oil refining. It is widely available and, in many regions, abundant, which helps keep prices competitive.</li>

		<li>Competitive Pricing: Due to the widespread availability of LPG and competition in the market, its prices are often competitive compared to other energy sources, such as electricity or heating oil.</li>

		<li>Energy Efficiency: LPG appliances are highly energy-efficient. LPG stoves and heaters heat up quickly, which can reduce energy consumption and, subsequently, lower energy bills.</li>

		<li>Cost-Effective for Bulk Users: For commercial and industrial users who require large quantities of energy, LPG can be cost-effective due to bulk purchasing options and efficient equipment.</li>

		<h2>Clean Energy:</h2>
	
		<ul>
		<li>Clean-Burning: LPG is a clean-burning fuel. When combusted, it produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants compared to many other fossil fuels. It emits lower levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter.</li>

		<li>Reduced Carbon Emissions: While LPG does emit carbon dioxide (CO2) when burned, it generally produces fewer CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared to coal and oil. This can help reduce the carbon footprint when LPG is used as a substitute for more carbon-intensive fuels.</li>

		<li>Indoor Air Quality: LPG is safer for indoor use than solid fuels like wood or coal, which can release harmful pollutants and particulates when burned. Using LPG for cooking or heating can result in better indoor air quality and reduced health risks.</li>

		<li>Versatility: LPG can be used for various applications, including cooking, heating, and powering vehicles. Its versatility allows it to replace less clean-burning fuels in multiple settings, contributing to cleaner energy use.</li>

		<li>Efficient Appliances: LPG appliances are designed for efficiency, which means they can utilize LPG effectively, reducing waste and emissions.</li>

		<li>Reduced Smog Formation: LPG combustion produces fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are key contributors to smog formation.</li>

		<li>Low Emissions During Transportation: LPG has lower emissions during transportation compared to some other fossil fuels. This can lead to reduced environmental impact in terms of transportation-related emissions.</li>
		</ul>
